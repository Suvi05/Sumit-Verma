**Definition** **:**The Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quick sort, heap sort, or merge sort.

# Details of Insertion Sort

- Insertion sort starts out by  saying that the first element is sorted. It grows the sorted partition  from left to right, and on each iteration it picks off the first element in the unsorted partition and it inserts in into the correct position in the sorted partition and it does that by shifting to right to make room for the new element
- Hint: Shadow Remains till it is finalized that yes it is suitable for that place.
- It is a in-Place Algorithm.
- In this we are **logically partitioning the array**, we don't have to create another array in order to perform the sort.
- We do create some variables during implementation, but that won't depend on the number of items we're sorting.(Like first 2 steps in adding sugar to tea, because those variables won't change the size of array).
- **O(n^2) time Complexity- Quadratic.**
- It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items,10,000 for 100 and so on...
- It doesn't have as much as swapping as in Bubble sort
- This is **Stable Algorithm.**
- A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the unsorted input.

# Implementation of Insertion Sort

```java
//Insertion Sort's Implementation
package com.array.sortings;

public class InsertionSort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] intArray = {20, 35, -15, 7, 55, 1, -22};

        System.out.println("Unorted Array");
        for (int i = 0; i < intArray.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(intArray[i]);
        }

        for (int firstUnsortedIndex = 1; firstUnsortedIndex < intArray.length; firstUnsortedIndex++) {
            int newElement = intArray[firstUnsortedIndex];

            int i;

            //Below code does the traversal for sorted partition and looks for the correct position to insert new element

            for (i = firstUnsortedIndex; i > 0 && intArray[i - 1] > newElement; i--) {
                intArray[i] = intArray[i - 1];
            }
            intArray[i] = newElement;
        }
        System.out.println("Sorted Array");
        for (int i = 0; i < intArray.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(intArray[i]);
        }
    }
}
//We don't swap, we shift the element in Insertion Sort
//The End
```

# Advantages of Insertion Sort

- The main advantage of the insertion sort is its simplicity.
- It also exhibits a good performance when dealing with a small list.
- The insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm so the space requirement is minimal.

# Disadvantages of Insertion Sort

- The disadvantage of the insertion sort is that it does not perform as well as other, better sorting algorithms.
- With n-squared steps required for every n element to be sorted, the insertion sort does not deal well with a huge list.
- Therefore, the insertion sort is particularly useful only when sorting a list of few items.

# Uses of Insertion Sort

- If the **cost of comparisons exceeds the cost of swaps**, as is the case for example with string keys stored by reference or with human interaction, then using binary insertion sort may yield better performance.
- A variant named binary merge sort uses a binary insertion sort to sort groups of 32 elements, followed by a final sort using merge sort.
- If a **skip list is used, the insertion time is brought down to O(log n)**, and swaps are not needed because the skip list is implemented on a linked list structure. The final running time for **insertion would be O(n log n)**.
